# Sync

The `sync` package in Go provides synchronization primitives that are commonly needed in concurrent programming. It includes tools for mutual exclusion (mutexes), wait groups, once execution, and other synchronization needs. Hereâ€™s an overview of some of the key components and their use cases:

#### 1. **Mutex (sync.Mutex)**

A `Mutex` is used to ensure that only one goroutine can access a critical section of code at a time. It is useful for protecting shared resources.

**Example:**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var (
	counter int
	mu      sync.Mutex
)

func increment(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	mu.Lock()
	counter++
	mu.Unlock()
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go increment(&wg)
	}

	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Counter:", counter)
}
```

#### 2. **RWMutex (sync.RWMutex)**

An `RWMutex` is a reader/writer mutual exclusion lock. It allows multiple readers to hold the lock simultaneously but only one writer at a time. This is useful when you have a resource that is read frequently but written infrequently.

**Example:**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

var (
	counter int
	rwMu    sync.RWMutex
)

func read(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	rwMu.RLock()
	defer rwMu.RUnlock()
	fmt.Println("Read counter:", counter)
}

func write(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	rwMu.Lock()
	counter++
	rwMu.Unlock()
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go write(&wg)
	}

	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go read(&wg)
	}

	wg.Wait()
}
```

#### 3. **WaitGroup (sync.WaitGroup)**

A `WaitGroup` waits for a collection of goroutines to finish executing. It is useful for ensuring that a set of concurrent tasks have completed before proceeding.

**Example:**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func worker(id int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d starting\n", id)
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go worker(i, &wg)
	}

	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("All workers completed")
}
```

#### 4. **Once (sync.Once)**

A `Once` ensures that a piece of code is executed only once, even if called from multiple goroutines.

**Example:**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var once sync.Once

func initialize() {
	fmt.Println("Initializing...")
}

func worker(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	once.Do(initialize)
	fmt.Println("Worker done")
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go worker(&wg)
	}

	wg.Wait()
}
```

#### 5. **Cond (sync.Cond)**

A `Cond` is used for waiting and signaling between goroutines. It allows goroutines to wait for some condition to be met.

**Example:**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

var (
	sharedRsc = false
	mu        sync.Mutex
	cond      = sync.NewCond(&mu)
)

func waitForResource(id int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	cond.L.Lock()
	for !sharedRsc {
		cond.Wait()
	}
	cond.L.Unlock()
	fmt.Printf("Goroutine %d proceeding\n", id)
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go waitForResource(i, &wg)
	}

	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)

	cond.L.Lock()
	sharedRsc = true
	cond.L.Unlock()
	cond.Broadcast()

	wg.Wait()
}
```

These are just a few of the many use cases for the `sync` package in Go. It is a powerful tool for handling concurrency and ensuring that your programs run correctly and efficiently.
