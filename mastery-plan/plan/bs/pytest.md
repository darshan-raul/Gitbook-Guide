# Pytest

Using the above reference to implement pytest in my code.&#x20;

Iam currently working on my CLI application for AWS. But it is getting frustrating and  illogical to use 'print' to troubleshoot the code. Also as I plan to create a package out of this code ultimately , Hence I desperately needed to create some test scenarios and put them to 'test' :p

So here we go :

{% embed url="https://github.com/darshan-raul/Python-CLI-for-AWS" %}

This is the code and I am going to start slow , add couple of tests and then ultimately will try to create a  total test coverage("pretty sure there is a term for this which I dont know yet)

{% hint style="info" %}
First of all , I created a folder just for all the test files to reside in. Lets call it 'tests'
{% endhint %}

### Configuration:

There are some simple ground rules while creating a pytest file or function:

1. &#x20;By default pytest only identifies the file names starting with **test\_** or ending with **\_test** as the test files.
2. &#x20;Pytest requires the test method names to :star2: _**start**_ :star2: with **"test**." All other method names will be ignored even if we explicitly ask to run those methods.

```
test_login.py - valid
login_test.py - valid
testlogin.py -invalid
logintest.py -invalid
```

```
def test_file1_method1(): - valid
def testfile1_method1(): - valid
def file1_method1(): - invalid	
```

### Running test's

```
py.test
```

This will run all the filenames starting with test\_ and the filenames ending with \_test in that folder and subfolders under that folder.

To run tests only from a specific file, we can use py.test \<filename>

```
py.test test_sample1.py
```

`pytest` allows you to use the standard python `assert` for verifying expectations and values in Python tests

```
def f():
    return 3


def test_function():
    assert f() == 4
```



### Sample file:

```
import boto3

s3=boto3.client('s3')

def test_getbuckets():
    bucketlist=[]
    buckets=s3.list_buckets()
    for i in buckets['Buckets']:
        bucket= i['Name']
        
        bucketlist.append(bucket)
    #print(bucketlist)
    assert bucketlist!=[] 
    
```

Nothing fancy just needs to check if the bucketlist is empty or not. If it isn't the code ran successfully.

**Output:**

![1 passed 2 warnings as the end result](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (44).png>)

Now I removed the s3 access for this AWS user and re-ran the test

![As expected it failed with 1 failed,2 warnings](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png>)

![You will also see a F in front of the file](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (46).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
Execute the test function with “quiet” reporting mode:
{% endhint %}

```
$ pytest -q test_sysexit.py
.                                                                    [100%]
1 passed in 0.12 seconds
```
