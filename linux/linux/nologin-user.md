# Nologin user

In Linux, a "nologin" user is a user account that is specifically designed to prevent interactive logins. It's typically used for:

* **System Accounts:** Accounts for services and daemons (like `ftp`, `www-data`, `nobody`) that don't require interactive access.
* **Temporarily Disabled Accounts:** Accounts for users that you want to temporarily prevent from logging in.
* **Security:** Restricting access to certain accounts to prevent unauthorized logins.

**How it Works:**

* **Shell Replacement:** The "nologin" shell (`/sbin/nologin` or `/usr/bin/false`) is assigned to the user's account.
* **Login Attempts:** When a user with the "nologin" shell tries to log in (via SSH, console, etc.), they are presented with a message indicating the account is unavailable and then denied access.

**Benefits:**

* **Security:** Helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive accounts.
* **Resource Management:** Prevents system accounts from consuming resources unnecessarily.
* **Flexibility:** Can be used to temporarily disable accounts or restrict access for specific users.

**How to Create a Nologin User:**

*   **Using `useradd`:**Bash

    ```
    sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin username
    ```
*   **Using `usermod` (for existing users):**Bash

    ```
    sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin username
    ```

**Important Considerations:**

* **No Shell Access:** Users with the "nologin" shell cannot run interactive shells or login remotely via SSH.
* **Processes:** Even though they can't log in, processes can still run under a nologin user's identity.
* **Alternative:** `/bin/false` can also be used as a shell for similar functionality, but it might not provide a user-friendly message.
