## Main guide

Will take time, 4 months maybe, but if you dedicate just 4 hours a week, in 4-5 months, you can be assured that you will never be frightened by a 'linux issue'

**Tip: There are 6 books, rotate your hour of learning between them so that you cover ground on each sitting.**

Will make you  a master of using linux practically. Give it a brisk read in one go, take notes of stuff you will need to dig into later, and then keep re-visiting this once in a while
