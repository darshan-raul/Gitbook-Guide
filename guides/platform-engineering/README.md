# Platform Engineering

Platform Engineering is the process of enabling software engineering teams so they can autonomously perform end-to-end operations of the application life cycle in a cloud environment. Platform Engineers develop an integrated product that provides self-service capabilities to developers.&#x20;

Luca Galante defines platform engineering as the <mark style="color:purple;">“discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud native era</mark>. Platform engineers provide an integrated product most often referred to as an ‘Internal Developer Platform’ covering the operation necessities of the entire life cycle of an application.”

Whether it is infrastructure provisioning, code pipelines, monitoring, or container management, the self-service platform hides all these complexities and provides developers with all the necessities of the entire life cycle of the application.&#x20;

Platform Engineering is not just‌ necessary tooling but a combination of tools, workflows, and processes.
