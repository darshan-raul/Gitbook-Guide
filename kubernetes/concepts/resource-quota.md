# Resource Quota

In Kubernetes, both **limits** and **requests** are crucial concepts for managing resource allocation for your containerized applications running within pods. However, they serve distinct purposes in defining resource requirements:

**1. Requests:**

* **Guarantee:** They represent the **minimum resources** that a pod **requires** to run successfully.
* **Scheduling:** The Kubernetes scheduler **considers the requested resources** of a pod when deciding on a suitable node to schedule it on. It ensures the node has enough available resources to fulfill the pod's needs before scheduling it.
* **No Enforcement:** Unlike limits, **requests are not strictly enforced** at runtime. Pods might receive more resources than they request if available on the node.

**2. Limits:**

* **Maximum:** They define the **maximum resources** a pod is **allowed to consume**.
* **Protection:** They serve as a **safety mechanism** to prevent pods from consuming excessive resources and potentially impacting the overall cluster's health or performance.
* **Enforced:** Kubernetes **enforces limits at runtime** and might throttle or even evict (kill) pods exceeding their limits.

**Key Differences and Use Cases:**

| Feature         | Requests                                             | Limits                                                         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Define minimum guaranteed resources                  | Define maximum allowed resource usage                          |
| **Scheduling**  | Used by scheduler for pod placement                  | Not considered during scheduling                               |
| **Enforcement** | Not strictly enforced                                | Strictly enforced at runtime                                   |
| **Use Cases**   | **Guaranteeing** minimum resources for critical pods | **Preventing** resource starvation and setting resource quotas |

**Here are some practical examples to illustrate the difference:**

* **Example 1:** A web server pod might request 1 CPU core and 1 GiB of memory but have a limit of 2 CPU cores and 2 GiB of memory. This ensures the pod receives at least the requested resources to run but prevents it from consuming more than the specified limits, protecting other pods on the node.
* **Example 2:** A batch job pod processing data might request 2 CPU cores and 4 GiB of memory but have no limit defined. This allows the pod to leverage more resources if available on the node to complete the job faster, but it doesn't guarantee that these resources will be available.

**Choosing the Right Values:**

Setting appropriate requests and limits is crucial for efficient resource management in Kubernetes. Here are some guidelines:

* **Requests:** Set them to the **minimum guaranteed resources** your application needs to function under normal load.
* **Limits:** Set them to a **reasonable upper bound** on resource usage, considering your application's typical behavior and leaving room for other pods on the node.

By carefully setting both requests and limits, you can ensure your pods have the resources they need while preventing resource overconsumption and maintaining the overall health and performance of your Kubernetes cluster.
