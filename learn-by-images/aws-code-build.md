# AWS CODE BUILD

AWS CodeBuild is a **fully managed** build service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers.

CodeBuild provides these benefits:

* **Fully managed** – CodeBuild eliminates the need to set up, patch, update, and manage your own build servers.
* **On demand** – CodeBuild scales on demand to meet your build needs. You pay only for the number of build minutes you consume.
* **Out of the box** – CodeBuild provides preconfigured build environments for the most popular programming languages. All you need to do is point to your build script to start your first build.
