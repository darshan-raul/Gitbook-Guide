# SRE

SREs are **responsible for the “availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response and capacity planning of their service(s)**.”&#x20;

They use service-level objectives (SLOs) and error budgets to set shared expectations for performance and balance reliability with innovation, respectively.



SRE is all about applying a software engineering mindset to system administration. As a software engineer, you look at the business requirements and develop the system. Likewise, a Service Reliability Engineer needs to look at how each disruption can affect the business requirement and then find a solution for it accordingly.
