# Maps did not replace drivers they enabled them - my thoughts on AI as a non AI bro

I happened to watch a video by [Venkat Subramaniam -  It AI-n't What You Think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMnH3obzCDk) and go on a long trip driving all the way in quick succession. An urge to write up an analogy came up in my head and here it is.

## Analogy

Pre 2010-15, if we had to go on a long trip we would have to rely on sign boards, asking people the next direction, physical maps you name it. Once digital maps like google maps started coming in, we have started heavily relying on them to go to places to the point that I can just sit in the car and go on a 300+ km trip without knowing the next turn outside my gate.  But have they solved everything or they are just a tool ? Humans still are at the drivers seat, `drive` being the keyword, maps can go haywire sometimes and we need to take our own calls, maps dont see the immediate diversions or the numerous speed breakers that come up every now and then.&#x20;



## My experience with AI

## My thoughts

sometimes maps can take you in incorrect directions

maps are great until you meet someone how lives there

use maps to create itenaries but dont use them to drive

adapt and adjust use the maps but build your own skills

speed breakers will always not be predicted by ai and will have to be handled

you drive as a team not individually

there are stilll people who cant read from maps and need help

maps evolved over time, street view, alt routes, diversions, road works

self driving cars will come some day&#x20;

ultimately knowing what you are doing is still supreme
