# Solutions Architecture

Solution architecture is the building blocks of solution development in the organization. It helps to create a successful solution in a complex organization, where product development has dependencies on multiple groups

Solution architecture not only considers the requirements of the business, but also handles critical, non-functional requirements such as scalability, high availability, maintainability, performance, security, and so on.



A solution architect is a person who is **responsible for** <mark style="color:purple;">designing solution architecture by collaborating across stakeholders</mark>.&#x20;

The solution architect **analyzes the functional requirement and defines a non-functional requirement in order to cover all aspects** of the solution and avoid any surprises.

**Each solution has multiple constraints** such as cost, budget, timeline, regulatory, and so on, and the **solution architect considers them, while also creating the design and making technology selection.**

The solution architect **develops a proof of concept and prototype in order to evaluate various technology platforms, and then chooses the best strategy for solution implementation**

The initial design of a solution architecture may be conceived at a very early stage during the pre-sales cycle, such as the request for proposal (RFP) or the request for information (RFI) and is followed by the creation of a prototype or proof of concept, in order to discover any solution risk.&#x20;

Solution architect also identifies whether to build a solution or to source it. It helps to identify technology selection, while also keeping an organization's critical security and compliance requirements in mind.&#x20;

**There could be two primary situations for creating a solution architecture:**&#x20;

* First, enhancing technology for an existing application, which may include hardware refresh or software re-architecting&#x20;
* Second, to create a new solution from scratch, where you get more flexibility to choose the best fit of technology to address a business requirement

**In the absence of solution architecture, there is a chance that:**

* software development could fail
* projects can&#x20;
  * get delayed,&#x20;
  * get over budget,&#x20;
  * and not deliver enough functionalities.

> A single problem can have multiple solutions, and each solution has its constraints.

A good solution architecture addresses the depth of different tools and technologies by investigating all possible architectural strategies, based on the mixed-use case, techniques, tools, and code reuse, <mark style="color:red;">**which comes from years of experience.**</mark>
