# SAML

**Imagine a scenario:** You need to access multiple web applications at work, each with its own login system. Logging in to each one repeatedly can be tedious and inefficient. SAML offers a solution for this by enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) across different applications.

**Here's how SAML works:**

1. **Actors Involved:** There are three main players in the SAML dance:
   * **Subject (You):** The end-user trying to access an application.
   * **Identity Provider (IdP):** A trusted central service that manages your user credentials. This could be your company's authentication system (e.g., Active Directory, Azure AD).
   * **Service Provider (SP):** The web application you're trying to access (e.g., CRM, project management tool).
2. **Authentication Flow:**
   * You attempt to access the Service Provider (SP) application.
   * The SP recognizes you haven't logged in yet and redirects you to the Identity Provider (IdP) for authentication.
   * **Behind the scenes:**
     * The SP sends an authentication request to the IdP, specifying what information it needs (e.g., username, group memberships).
   * You log in to the IdP using your usual credentials (username/password).
   * **If successful:**
     * The IdP verifies your credentials and creates a SAML assertion document containing your identity information (e.g., username, roles). This document is digitally signed by the IdP for security.
     * The IdP sends the signed SAML assertion back to the SP.
   * **The SP receives the assertion:**
     * It validates the signature to ensure it came from a trusted IdP.
     * If valid, it extracts your identity information from the assertion and grants you access to the application based on your permissions.

**Benefits of SAML:**

* **Single Sign-On (SSO):** You only need to log in once to the IdP, and your authentication is automatically handled for other SAML-enabled applications.
* **Centralized Identity Management:** The IdP manages all user credentials, simplifying administration and improving security.
* **Improved Security:** SAML uses secure protocols and digital signatures to protect user credentials during the exchange.

**Things to Remember:**

* SAML is an XML-based standard, so the communication between parties involves XML documents.
* Different versions of SAML exist (SAML 2.0 is the most common).
* SAML primarily focuses on authentication, not authorization (access control within applications).

By using SAML, you can achieve a more streamlined and secure login experience across various applications within your organization.
