# Stateful vs Stateless

The concepts of **stateless** and **stateful** applications revolve around how an application handles and stores data (or "state") between requests. This is particularly important when scaling applications, deploying in distributed environments like cloud, or discussing microservices architecture.

#### 1. **Stateless Applications**

A **stateless application** <mark style="background-color:orange;">does not retain any data or "state" between different requests from the same client.</mark> Each request is independent, and the server processes it without needing information about previous interactions. Once a request is handled, no session or data about that request is retained.

**Examples:**

* **REST APIs**: RESTful APIs are designed to be stateless. Each API request contains all the necessary information (like authentication, parameters) for processing without depending on previous requests.
* **Web Servers (Serving Static Content)**: A server that simply serves HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files, without tracking user sessions, can be considered stateless.
* **Serverless Functions (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)**: These execute code in response to events without storing information about previous executions.

**Key Characteristics:**

* **Scalable**: Since no state is stored between requests, scaling stateless applications horizontally is easy. Any instance of the application can handle any request.
* **Simplified Failover**: If a stateless server fails, the user can be routed to another instance without loss of information, since no state is tied to any particular instance.
* **Idempotent**: Many stateless operations are idempotent, meaning they can be called multiple times with the same result.

#### 2. **Stateful Applications**

A **stateful application** retains information (state) about a client's session or interactions across multiple requests. This state could be user authentication, session data, a transaction, or any data that needs to persist across requests.

**Examples:**

* **Databases**: Databases inherently manage state because they store persistent data across transactions and client interactions.
* **User Sessions in Web Applications**: Applications that manage sessions (e.g., via cookies or server-side session storage) are stateful because they remember logged-in users or track their actions during a session.
* **Chat Applications**: A chat service that needs to remember the conversation history, current participants, and message states across sessions is stateful.
* **Streaming Services (e.g., Netflix)**: The state is maintained for what the user is watching, what timestamp they are at, recommendations, etc.

**Key Characteristics:**

* **Session Data**: Stateful applications typically store user-related data between requests, either on the server (e.g., session storage) or on the client (e.g., session tokens).
* **Harder to Scale Horizontally**: Since each instance holds state for specific sessions or data, scaling horizontally can require special techniques, such as sticky sessions or a distributed state store.
* **Complex Failover**: When a stateful server fails, session data can be lost unless replicated or stored externally.

#### Summary of Qualities:

| **Aspect**             | **Stateless**                                                       | **Stateful**                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Session Management** | No session maintained, each request independent                     | Session maintained between requests                            |
| **Scaling**            | Easy to scale horizontally                                          | Harder to scale, may require session replication               |
| **Failure Handling**   | Easy failover, no state to restore                                  | Complex failover, need to manage state consistency             |
| **Typical Use Cases**  | REST APIs, web servers serving static content, serverless functions | Databases, chat apps, streaming services, e-commerce platforms |
| **Storage of State**   | None                                                                | Stored in server memory, database, or client                   |

## Gotcha

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
in case of a chat app, if i keep all its 'state' store outside of the application say a seperate sql db, a seperate redis db, will it still qaulify as a stateful application because its storing the state for individual requests or does it now become a stateless app?
```
{% endcode %}

This is a great question and touches on a subtle but important distinction between **where state is stored** versus **whether an application is stateful or stateless**.

Even if a chat application **outsources all of its state** (e.g., to a separate SQL database for message history, or to Redis for session and participant data), the **application** itself is still **stateful**. Here’s why:

#### Why It's Still Stateful:

* **The application requires the state to function correctly**. Although the state is stored externally (in Redis or SQL), the application still relies on that state to maintain a user's session, retrieve chat history, manage participants, and track real-time interactions.
* **State is necessary to process requests**: For example, when a user sends a message, the application needs to know the current participants in the chat (from Redis), load prior messages (from SQL), and potentially track whether a user is online (another piece of state). So, each request is not fully independent — it depends on the state stored externally.
* **State management is part of the logic**: Even if you're not managing the state in the application memory, you're still handling session consistency, ensuring messages are delivered correctly, and maintaining user presence—all of which are characteristics of a stateful app.

#### Stateless ≠ No External State:

Just storing the state outside the application (in databases or caches) doesn’t make the application stateless. A stateless application **doesn't rely on previous interactions** or a persistent state **per request**. But in your chat app example:

* The chat app needs to maintain **who is in the conversation**, **chat history**, **user presence**, and possibly **message delivery statuses**.
* Even if those are stored externally, the **application logic** still **depends on that data** for correct functioning, meaning it has state that persists across requests.

#### Could It Be Considered Stateless?

For an application to be **truly stateless**, it needs to be designed in such a way that:

* Each request contains all necessary information for the application to process it without depending on any prior interaction or stored session information.
* The server doesn’t track any ongoing conversations, user presence, or message statuses in a way that’s session-specific.

In a chat app scenario, this would be highly impractical. Even if you put the data in Redis or SQL, the **requirement to retrieve and use this state between requests** makes the app stateful by nature.

#### Key Distinction:

* **Where state is stored** (internally or externally) doesn’t necessarily determine if an app is stateless or stateful.
* **How the app behaves and whether it requires state across requests** is what determines it.

#### Example of a Truly Stateless Application:

A **REST API** that provides read-only access to a resource, like fetching a public catalog of books, could be considered stateless. Each request (e.g., `GET /books`) is independent, and the API doesn’t store session-specific data or need to recall previous interactions with the user.

#### In Conclusion:

Even though your chat app stores state externally (in Redis or SQL), it's still **stateful** because it **depends on state across requests** to function properly. State is still being **managed** and **maintained** (just not in the app memory), which qualifies it as stateful.
