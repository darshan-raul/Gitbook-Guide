# GHz?

**What is GHz?**

* **Stands for:** Gigahertz
* **Unit of Measurement:** Measures the clock speed of a computer's processor (CPU).
* **Hertz (Hz):** One cycle per second
* **Gigahertz (GHz):** One billion cycles per second

**How GHz Impacts Performance**

* **Clock Speed:** The clock speed determines how many instructions a processor can execute in a single second. A CPU with a 3.0 GHz clock speed can execute 3 billion instructions per second.
* **Faster is (Usually) Better:** In general, a higher clock speed means a faster processor, especially when comparing processors within the same generation and family.
* **It's Not the Only Factor:** Clock speed is important, but other aspects also affect a processor's performance:
  * **Cores:** The number of independent processing units within a CPU (more cores = potential to do more work at once).
  * **Cache:** A small, fast memory that stores frequently used data.
  * **Architecture:** The overall design of the processor.

**Practical Examples with i3/i5**

* **Intel Core i3:** These processors are typically found in budget-friendly and mid-range laptops or desktops. Clock speeds vary depending on the model and generation but often range from around 2.0 GHz to 4.0 GHz.
* **Intel Core i5:** These processors offer better performance than i3, making them suitable for demanding tasks like gaming or content creation. Clock speeds are generally higher than i3, going up to 4.5 GHz or higher on some models.

**Example:**

* An Intel Core i5-12400 with a base clock speed of 2.5 GHz and a boost clock speed of 4.4 GHz.
  * This means the processor runs normally at 2.5 billion cycles per second but can temporarily boost up to 4.4 billion cycles per second for demanding tasks.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Don't just compare clock speeds:** Look at the number of cores, cache size, and CPU generation when comparing processors. A higher clock speed on an older generation processor might not outperform a newer generation processor with a slightly lower clock speed.
* **Software requirements:** Understand your usage needs. Demanding software will benefit more from a faster CPU.
