# Prompt Engineering Patterns

#### **Prompt Engineering Patterns â€“ A Comprehensive Guide**

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing prompts to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs). Various **prompt engineering patterns** have emerged, each serving a unique purpose in improving AI-generated outputs. Below, we explore these patterns in detail, with examples for each.

***

### **1. Zero-Shot Prompting**

#### **Definition**

Zero-shot prompting is when you ask the model to perform a task without providing any examples. The model relies on its pretrained knowledge to generate a response.

#### **Example**

**Task: Identify if a given sentence is positive or negative.**

**Prompt:**

```
Is the following sentence positive or negative?
"I love the new update; it's fantastic!"
```

**Response:**\
"Positive."

#### **Use Cases**

* Quick classification tasks
* Basic text summarization
* General knowledge-based queries

#### **Limitations**

* May not always be accurate for complex or nuanced tasks
* Can struggle with ambiguous inputs

***

### **2. Few-Shot Prompting**

#### **Definition**

Few-shot prompting provides a few examples (shots) in the prompt to help the model understand the expected output format and improve accuracy.

#### **Example**

**Task: Sentiment classification with examples.**

**Prompt:**

```
Classify the sentiment of the following sentences:
1. "The food was amazing!" â†’ Positive
2. "I hate waiting in long lines." â†’ Negative
3. "The product quality is disappointing." â†’ Negative
4. "This new feature is fantastic!" â†’ 
```

**Response:**\
"Positive."

#### **Use Cases**

* When the model needs contextual guidance
* Text classification
* Translation tasks

#### **Limitations**

* Requires manual selection of good examples
* Can be inconsistent if the examples donâ€™t cover edge cases

***

### **3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**

#### **Definition**

CoT prompting encourages the model to **think step-by-step** before reaching a conclusion, improving reasoning and logical accuracy.

#### **Example**

**Task: Solve a math problem using reasoning.**

**Prompt:**

```
Q: Tom has 3 apples. He buys 5 more apples. Then he gives 2 apples to his friend. How many apples does he have now?
Let's think step by step.
```

**Response:**

```
Tom starts with 3 apples.
He buys 5 more, so now he has 3 + 5 = 8 apples.
He gives 2 apples away, so now he has 8 - 2 = 6 apples.
The final answer is 6 apples.
```

#### **Use Cases**

* Math problem-solving
* Logical reasoning
* Code debugging and explanations

#### **Limitations**

* Longer responses increase computational cost
* If the model starts with an incorrect step, the whole answer may be wrong

***

### **4. Self-Consistency Prompting**

#### **Definition**

Instead of generating a single response, the model generates **multiple outputs** for a prompt and selects the most frequent or consistent answer.

#### **Example**

**Task: Solve a logic puzzle.**

**Prompt:**

```
If all roses are flowers and some flowers fade quickly, does it mean that all roses fade quickly?  
Let's think step by step.
```

(The model generates multiple responses, and the most common answer is selected.)

**Response:**

```
No, because "some flowers fade quickly" does not mean "all flowers fade quickly." Roses are a subset of flowers, and we don't know if roses specifically fade quickly.
```

#### **Use Cases**

* Reducing hallucination in complex reasoning tasks
* Improving reliability of AI-generated explanations

#### **Limitations**

* Computationally expensive
* Requires multiple inference runs

***

### **5. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Prompting**

#### **Definition**

ReAct combines **reasoning** and **taking actions** by making the model think, then act accordingly. It is useful in interactive tasks.

#### **Example**

**Task: Solve a maze where the model decides where to move next.**

**Prompt:**

```
You are in a maze. You see paths leading left, right, and forward.
1. Think: Analyze which path is best based on the clues you see.
2. Act: Choose a direction to move.
What do you do?
```

**Response:**

```
Think: The forward path looks clear, but I hear noises from the right.  
Act: Move forward.
```

#### **Use Cases**

* AI agents that interact with users dynamically
* Decision-making systems (e.g., game AI, chatbots)

#### **Limitations**

* Requires iterative interactions, making it slower
* Needs structured environments where actions lead to meaningful outcomes

***

### **6. Instruction Prompting**

#### **Definition**

Instruction prompting explicitly tells the model what to do, making it **follow precise guidelines**.

#### **Example**

**Task: Generate a summary in exactly three sentences.**

**Prompt:**

```
Summarize the following article in exactly three sentences:  
[Article text here]
```

**Response:**

```
The article discusses the recent advancements in AI. It highlights the role of reinforcement learning in improving model performance. Future trends indicate increasing use of human feedback in AI training.
```

#### **Use Cases**

* Controlling output length and format
* Ensuring consistency in responses

#### **Limitations**

* If the instructions are unclear, the model may not follow them correctly

***

### **7. Role-Playing Prompting**

#### **Definition**

In this pattern, the model is asked to **assume a specific role** to make responses more engaging and context-aware.

#### **Example**

**Task: Act as a cybersecurity expert giving advice.**

**Prompt:**

```
You are a cybersecurity expert. Explain why using strong passwords is important.
```

**Response:**

```
As a cybersecurity expert, I highly recommend using strong passwords to prevent unauthorized access. Weak passwords make it easier for hackers to breach accounts using brute-force attacks. Always use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols to maximize security.
```

#### **Use Cases**

* AI-powered tutors and assistants
* Simulating customer support interactions

#### **Limitations**

* If not carefully controlled, the model may **hallucinate** expertise it does not have

***

### **8. Iterative Refinement Prompting**

#### **Definition**

In this approach, the model is given **incremental feedback** to refine its response step by step.

#### **Example**

**Task: Improve a piece of writing based on feedback.**

**Prompt:**

```
Here is my paragraph:  
"The sun was bright. It was hot outside."  

Make it more descriptive.
```

**Response:**

```
The golden sun blazed in the clear blue sky, casting shimmering heatwaves over the sunbaked pavement.
```

#### **Use Cases**

* Creative writing and content improvement
* Code refactoring and debugging

#### **Limitations**

* Requires iterative interactions, making it slower

#### **Final Thoughts**

| **Pattern**            | **Use Case**                   |
