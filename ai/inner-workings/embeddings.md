# Embeddings

Embeddings are a fundamental concept in AI models, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. In simple terms, an embedding is a way to represent complex data, such as words, images, or audio, as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space.What's the purpose of embeddings?The primary goal of embeddings is to capture the semantic meaning and relationships between data points. By mapping data to a vector space, embeddings enable AI models to perform various tasks, such as:

1. Similarity search: Find similar data points based on their vector representations.
2. Clustering: Group similar data points together.
3. Classification: Classify data points into categories based on their vector representations.
4. Recommendation systems: Suggest items based on their vector representations.

Types of embeddings:

1. Word embeddings: Represent words as vectors, capturing their semantic meaning and relationships. Examples include Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText.
2. Image embeddings: Represent images as vectors, capturing their visual features and relationships. Examples include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers.
3. Audio embeddings: Represent audio signals as vectors, capturing their acoustic features and relationships.

How are embeddings created?Embeddings are typically created using neural networks, which learn to map input data to vector representations through self-supervised or supervised learning. The process involves:

1. Data preprocessing: Preprocess the data, such as tokenizing text or resizing images.
2. Model training: Train a neural network on the preprocessed data, using a suitable loss function and optimization algorithm.
3. Vector representation: Obtain the vector representation of the input data by passing it through the trained neural network.

Popular embedding algorithms:

1. Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013)
2. GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014)
3. FastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017)
4. BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)

### How are embeddings used in RAG?

In RAG, embeddings are used to represent the input query, the retrieved documents, and the generated text. These embeddings enable the model to capture semantic similarities and relationships between the input query, the retrieved information, and the generated text.Here are some ways embeddings are used in RAG:

1. Query embedding: The input query is embedded into a vector representation, which is used to retrieve relevant documents from the corpus.
2. Document embedding: The retrieved documents are embedded into vector representations, which are used to compute similarities with the query embedding.
3. Context embedding: The retrieved documents are used to create a context embedding, which represents the relevant information retrieved from the corpus.
4. Generator embedding: The generator uses the context embedding to produce a sequence of tokens, which are embedded into vector representations to compute the final generated text.

### Benefits of using embeddings in RAG

Using embeddings in RAG provides several benefits:

1. Improved retrieval: Embeddings enable the model to capture semantic similarities between the input query and the retrieved documents, leading to more accurate retrieval.
2. Better contextual understanding: Embeddings help the model to understand the context in which the retrieved information is relevant, leading to more coherent and accurate generated text.
3. Increased efficiency: Embeddings can be computed efficiently using techniques like matrix multiplication, making it possible to process large amounts of data quickly.
