# Sagemaker

## Features

Use [Amazon SageMaker Canvas](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/canvas/) to automatically explore different solutions and find the best model for your given dataset.

[Amazon Augmented AI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-use-augmented-ai-a2i-human-review-loops.html)

Build the workflows required for human review of ML predictions. Amazon A2I brings human review to all developers, removing the <mark style="color:purple;">undifferentiated heavy lifting</mark> associated with building human review systems or managing large numbers of human reviewers.

[AutoML step](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/build-and-manage-steps.html)

Create an AutoML job to automatically train a model in Pipelines.

[SageMaker Autopilot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-automate-model-development.html)

Users without machine learning knowledge can quickly build classification and regression models.

[Batch Transform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/batch-transform.html)

Preprocess datasets, run inference when you don't need a persistent endpoint, and associate input records with inferences to assist the interpretation of results.

[SageMaker Clarify](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/clarify-configure-processing-jobs.html#clarify-fairness-and-explainability)

SageMaker Clarif<mark style="color:purple;">y automatically evaluates foundation models for your generative AI use case with metrics such as accuracy, robustness, and toxicity to support your responsible AI initiative.</mark> SageMaker Clarify explains how input features contribute to your model predictions during model development and inference. Evaluate your FM during customization using automatic and human-based evaluations.

Improve your machine learning models by <mark style="color:purple;">detecting potential bias</mark> and help explain the predictions that models make. You can use Amazon SageMaker Clarify to understand fairness and model explainability and to explain and detect bias in your models. You can configure an SageMaker Clarify processing job to compute bias metrics and feature attributions and generate reports for model explainability. SageMaker Clarify processing jobs are implemented using a specialized SageMaker Clarify container image.

[Collaboration with shared spaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/domain-space.html)

A shared space consists of a shared JupyterServer application and a shared directory. All user profiles in a Amazon SageMaker AI domain have access to all shared spaces in the domain.

[SageMaker Data Wrangler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/data-wrangler.html)

Import, analyze, prepare, and featurize data in SageMaker Studio. You can integrate Data Wrangler into your machine learning workflows to simplify and streamline data pre-processing and feature engineering using little to no coding. You can also add your own Python scripts and transformations to customize your data prep workflow.

[Data Wrangler data preparation widget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/data-wrangler-interactively-prepare-data-notebook.html)

Interact with your data, get visualizations, explore actionable insights, and fix data quality issues.

[SageMaker Debugger](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/train-debugger.html)

[SageMaker Experiments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/experiments.html)

Experiment management and tracking. You can use the tracked data to reconstruct an experiment, incrementally build on experiments conducted by peers, and trace model lineage for compliance and audit verifications.

[SageMaker Feature Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/feature-store.html)

A centralized store for features and associated metadata so features can be easily discovered and reused. You can create two types of stores, an Online or Offline store. The Online Store can be used for low latency, real-time inference use cases and the Offline Store can be used for training and batch inference.

[SageMaker Ground Truth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms.html)

To train a machine learning model, you need a large, high-quality, labeled dataset. Ground Truth helps you build high-quality training datasets for your machine learning models. With Ground Truth, you can use workers from either Amazon Mechanical Turk, a vendor company that you choose, or an internal, private workforce along with machine learning to enable you to create a labeled dataset. You can use the labeled dataset output from Ground Truth to train your own models. You can also use the output as a training dataset for an Amazon SageMaker AI model.

[SageMaker Ground Truth Plus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gtp.html)

A turnkey data labeling feature to create high-quality training datasets without having to build labeling applications and manage the labeling workforce on your own.

[SageMaker Inference Recommender](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/inference-recommender.html)
