# App Mesh vs VPC Lattice

AWS App Mesh and Amazon VPC Lattice are both services designed to simplify service-to-service communication in modern applications, but they differ significantly in their scope, functionality, and use cases. Below is a detailed comparison:

### **Key Differences Between AWS App Mesh and Amazon VPC Lattice**

| **Feature**                    | **AWS App Mesh**                                                                                   | **Amazon VPC Lattice**                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**                    | Provides application-level networking for microservices within a service mesh.                     | Simplifies service-to-service communication across VPCs and accounts at both the network and application layers.         |
| **Scope**                      | Focuses on managing communication within microservices architectures (e.g., HTTP/TCP services).    | Designed for broader service networking across VPCs, accounts, and compute types (instances, containers, serverless).    |
| **Traffic Management**         | Enables fine-grained traffic routing using virtual routers and routes within a service mesh.       | Offers advanced traffic management, including request-level routing and weighted targets for deployments.                |
| **Connectivity**               | Connects services via Envoy proxies within a mesh; requires sidecar proxies for each service.      | Automatically manages connectivity between VPCs and accounts without requiring sidecar proxies.                          |
| **Authentication & Security**  | Relies on Envoy proxy for secure communication; integrates with IAM for access control.            | Provides multi-layer security: IAM-based policies, security groups, and network ACLs at both service and network levels. |
| **Monitoring & Observability** | Provides end-to-end visibility of application traffic using Envoy proxies.                         | Includes centralized monitoring of service networks and connectivity across VPCs/accounts.                               |
| **Deployment Flexibility**     | Works with Amazon EC2, ECS, EKS, Fargate, Kubernetes, and on-premises apps via AWS Outposts.       | Supports instances, containers, serverless applications, and TCP resources like databases across VPCs/accounts.          |
| **Use Case Examples**          | Ideal for microservices architectures needing detailed traffic control (e.g., canary deployments). | Suitable for organizations managing multi-VPC/multi-account environments with overlapping IP addresses.                  |

### **When to Use Each Service**

#### **AWS App Mesh**

* Best suited for applications built using microservices that require detailed traffic routing and observability.
* Ideal for managing HTTP/TCP communication between services deployed on platforms like Kubernetes or AWS ECS/EKS.
* Requires sidecar proxies (Envoy) to handle traffic routing and monitoring.

#### **Amazon VPC Lattice**

* Designed for organizations with complex multi-VPC or multi-account setups needing simplified connectivity.
* Useful when connecting services across different compute types (instances, containers, serverless) without the need for sidecar proxies.
* Provides broader capabilities like automatic connectivity management between VPCs/accounts and centralized service discovery.

***

In summary, AWS App Mesh is specialized for microservices communication within a service mesh using application-level networking controls, while Amazon VPC Lattice provides a broader solution for connecting services across multiple VPCs/accounts with simplified network management and security features.
